 <h4>behaviour:</h4>
Most of these birds are diurnal, and active during the day. Their social behavior, however, varies from species to species. Most species are solitary outside of the breeding season, though some species do live in pairs or small flocks.Some species are incredibly territorial, usually protecting a nest or an important food source. They spend their time patrolling their territories and foraging for food by drumming their bills against tree trunks and branches.

 Parrots are highly social. In the wild, parrots stay in touch using contact calls. Always be sure to greet your parrot when you first come home, and say good-bye when you leave the room. Also give a gentle, simple response to contact calls. Parrots will give an occasional chirp, & a short response like “HI, what are you doing” from you would be good.Parrots have been compared mentally and emotionally to toddlers. They are intelligent, playful, and possessive. They have short attention spans, lots of energy, and they seem to enjoy dramatic displays.

Sparrows are social birds. They often form flocks with other birds. Roosting and formation of nests are done in groupings. They exhibit dust bathing by scratching a hole in the ground, sit on it and then bath with the dust by flinging dust on their body. They also bath in puddles. They exhibit social singing to call each other.

Sparrows roost in shrubs and trees. They make some chirping sounds before and after settling in the roost. These birds can perform specific tasks for obtaining food including doors opening for entering into supermarkets and watching passersby’s by clinging to hotel walls.
